			The following page is a hand-coded website chronicling my journey to becoming a web developer. Each blog post will be coupled with some minor or major revision to the structure and style of the website as I learn more about HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and MySQL. I'm building and learning from the ground up with the intention of applying to a coding bootcamp next year. Come join me and see how everything unfolds after the jump!

			<p>It's crazy to think that I'm actually going to attempt what I'm about to do when seven months ago, I don't think I would have even considered it. I'm going to teach myself how to develop a site and a build a web app in preparation for the coding bootcamps I'll be applying to this fall.</p>
			
			<p>That means in six months time, I hope to have a professional portfolio and an established presence in the online dev community, enough so that I can confidently submit an application to either <a href ="http://www.hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a> or <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>.</p>
			
			<p>Obviously, this is the first blog post of many more to come (fingers crossed) so it's going to be very bare and introductory at best. There is a lot you need to know about where I am coming from and exactly where I plan to go, but for now I'll leave you with my intention for creating this website and what you can expect if you follow. With each new post, I will attach a screenshot of the what this website looked like before I the most recent changes to the code. This way, I can trace the changes I make to my page as well as my growth as a web developer.</p>
			
			<p>I'm not exaggerating when I say this entire process is coming from the ground up and I will elaborate more on this process in the upcoming posts. Let's just take it one post at a time to make sure you keep coming back. Hopefully the idea of this blog is enough of a hook for you.
			
			<p>Thank you for reading and hope to see you at the next post! (By the way, I've had to resist every urge to riddle this post with emojis so pat on the back to me, yay.)</p>
			
			<p>Happy Coding,</p>
